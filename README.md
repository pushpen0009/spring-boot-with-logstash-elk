- create logstash.conf file and place it anywhere and paste the content similar logstash-sample.conf which is inside this project of resources folder and run this command to run logstash=>
logstash.bat -f /path/logstash.conf

The log messages generated by the springboot application will send to Logstash and then forwarded to the Elasticsearch 
by Logstash and then you can browser them by using Kibana.
